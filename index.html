        <p>My name is Greg Zahora and after 4 years as a financial analyst, working in interest rate/liquidity risk and
            equity research, I am working on becoming a software developer. I noticed in my previous career that I was
            most engaged when I was automating excel spreadsheets and creating complicated nested IF statements, leading
            me to the realization that I was in the wrong industry. This led me to quit finance all together and work to
            become a software developer.</p>
        <p>In my free time I like to be outdoors hiking and camping; I try to spend one or two weeks a year on a major
            hiking/camping trip. I've been to eight North American national parks. My favorites parks so far are Zion
            National Park and Banff National Park.</p>
        </br>
        <p> I try to spend my more-limited daily free time keeping up with current events and geopolitical affairs. It's
            a goal of mine to be informed enough to be able to have a conversation about any subject. I'm getting
            close... but am lacking most in the pop-culture department.</p>
